# codeandgo

### I should have done this 2 years ago, compiling all the lessons that I've learned and share it with the people who also wanted to learn about web development. This will also help me track my progress through out time.

### I will be creating code snippets, and try to explain the possible I can.

### I will be putting all the code or syntax together to create an application or web application that explains how it work, whether video format or through text.
