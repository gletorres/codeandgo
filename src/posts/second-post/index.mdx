excerpt: With the help of some online courses, and some hours of online videos that took me a week to figure out how to fix errors caused by some outdated dependencies that taught me a lot on how to figure out where to find the resolution. Thanks to google, and other handful communities like Slack, Discord, Reddit, StackOverflow, and the ReactJS community.
