excerpt: Itâ€™s been a while since I started web development. In this article, I will explain how I started coding, from making a single basic component to complex components, breaking complex code into a single piece of components to render a single file into the browser and other stuff.

## What is useState and why do you use it?

-You can have state in your class component, you can construct component with state and then you can use that state to display the information inside of the render method and manipulate the state with certain function because you use "this.state". The problem is, you cannot do this within the functional component, that is why useState and useEffect hooks came into place.

### Rules of using React hooks as stated in the React documentations

- Only call hooks at the Top level, means the very line inside the function you created.
- Only call hooks from React Functions, not in a class component.

Visit: [React Hooks Rules](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).

### I'll give you the basics and very common example of using useState that most of the React developer's used.

`Increment and Decrement using useState`

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
}
```

Or you can place increment function before the return statement.

```js
import React, { useState } from "react"

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  //or you can create an increment function here instead of inline.
  //Increment
  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1)
  }
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {count}
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

`Now we can add the decrement function`

```js
import React, { useState } from "react"

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  //or you can create an increment function here instead of inline
  //Increment
  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1)
  }
  //Decrement
  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - 1)
  }
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {count}
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Derement</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

### Another example:

```js
import React, { useState } from "react"

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(10)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
      <div>{count}</div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

Or

```js
import React, { useState } from "react"

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(10)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
      <div>{count}</div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
